#Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand Using Linear Regression

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands


#Conclusions
1. Company should focus more on Non-rainy days (summer and fall season has more count)
2. Company should focus more on temperature based bike availability
3. september has a good relation with total count, so company should focus more on september month.
4. Rains and bad weather impact the total count so they should focus on alternative measures such as providing a 
    rain cheater and so on.
5. Some seasons like spring has a high negative correlation with count, means very less number of counts those 
    seasons,so company must focus on that.
6. holidays leads to drop in counts, company must come with a plan to avoid count reduction in holidays.
